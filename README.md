# tictactoe
Little tictactoe game C#

Type computer to player2 and you can play vs AI.
This is how AI is made to work:
priority 1:  get tick tac toe
priority 2:  block x tic tac toe
priority 3:  go for middle space
priority 4:  go for corner space
priority 5:  pick open space
From original source I  fixed couple of bugs and changed the AI priority.
